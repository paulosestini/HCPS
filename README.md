# HCPS
The Hyper Cool Physics Simulator (HCPS) is an engine that is capable of simulating deformable structures and fluids 

The engine simulates the structures and fluids by systems of particles connected by bonds. These bonds have different properties
depending on what is being simulated.

It's written in C++, using the SFML library for the graphics and keyboard/mouse input.
